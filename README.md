# üñåÔ∏è colorole++

A simple Discord bot to change username's colors by changing roles.

Written in C++ to prove ***<a href="https://github.com/bubu1441006/colorole">bubu</a> is non*** and I'm superior to him.

# Requirements
- C++17 (GNU GCC 11.1.0)
- CMake 3.22 (although a bit older is fine)
- <a href="https://github.com/brainboxdotcc/DPP">D++</a>

# Building instructions
- Create 2 directories: `libs` and `build`
- Enter `libs` to <a href="https://github.com/brainboxdotcc/DPP">D++</a>, then go back
- `cmake -S . -B ./build`
- `make -C build`

The executable `colorole` will appear.
